Twitdrang is a userscript that makes the timeline at twitter.com narrower. I use it and Fluid to make a smallish site-specific browser (SSB) dedicated to Twitter.

The timeline looks like this

Scrolling to the right reveals the sidebar with the other Twitter tools.

The `install.sh` script copies the userscript from the working folder to the appropriate spot in `~/Library/Application Support/Fluid`. The Twitter SSB I use this with is just called "Twitter." If you use a different name for your SSB, you'll have to change the destination folder name in `install.sh`.
